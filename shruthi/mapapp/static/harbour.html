Nagapattinam Harbour is a natural port located in the Bay of Bengal, specifically in the Tamil Nadu state of India. It is situated at the mouth of the river Kaduvayar and has been a significant maritime hub for centuries. The harbour is known for its historical importance during the Medieval Cholas period and has been a key port for trade and naval expeditions. It was later colonized by the Portuguese and later the Dutch, who made it the capital of the Dutch Coromandel. The British East India Company later captured the town in 1781. </p>
